# Project idea

## Task 1: Introduction to the Project

### 1. Project Overview:
- **Name of the project:** Weather App
- **Description:** A web-based application that provides real-time weather information for different locations. Users can search for weather forecasts, view temperature, humidity, wind speed, and other meteorological data.
- **Key Goals/Objectives:**
  - Deliver accurate weather forecasts.
  - Allow users to search for weather information by city or location.
  - Provide a user-friendly interface for both desktop and mobile devices.
  - Integrate with external weather APIs for real-time data.

### 2. Stakeholders Identification:
- **End Users:** Individuals seeking weather updates.
- **Developers:** Responsible for coding and maintaining the application.
- **Project Managers:** Oversee project progress and timelines.
- **External Systems/APIs:** Weather data providers (e.g., OpenWeatherMap API).

## Task 2: Functional Requirements

### 1. Define Functional Requirements:
- Users can search for weather by city name.
- Display current temperature, humidity, wind speed, and weather conditions.
- Users can view a 7-day forecast.
- Users can toggle between Celsius and Fahrenheit.
- Users can save favorite locations.

### 2. Break Down Requirements:
- "Search for weather by city name":
  - Input city name in a search bar.
  - Fetch weather data from API.
  - Display weather information.

- "Toggle between Celsius and Fahrenheit":
  - UI button to switch units.
  - Update displayed temperature units dynamically.

### 3. Prioritize Functional Requirements:
- High Priority: Search weather, display current weather data.
- Medium Priority: Save favorite locations.
- Low Priority: Toggle between units.

## Task 3: Non-Functional Requirements

### 1. Define Non-Functional Requirements:
- Performance: Load weather data within 2 seconds.
- Security: Secure API communication with HTTPS.
- Scalability: Support up to 10,000 concurrent users.
- Usability: Responsive design for both desktop and mobile.

### 2. Prioritize Non-Functional Requirements:
- High Priority: Performance and Security.
- Medium Priority: Usability.
- Low Priority: Scalability.

## Task 4: Use Cases and User Stories

### 1. Create Use Cases:
- **Title:** Search Weather by City.
- **Primary Actor:** User.
- **Goal:** View current weather information.
- **Preconditions:** User opens the application.
- **Main Flow:**
  1. User enters city name.
  2. System fetches data from the weather API.
  3. System displays weather details.
- **Postconditions:** Weather information is displayed.
- **Alternative Flow:** If the city name is invalid, show an error message.

### 2. Write User Stories:
- As a user, I want to search for weather information by city so that I can plan my day.
- As a user, I want to view a 7-day forecast to make travel plans.
- As a user, I want to switch between Celsius and Fahrenheit to understand temperature in my preferred unit.

## Task 5: Documenting System Architecture (Optional)

### 1. System Architecture:
- **User Interface (UI):** React-based front-end.
- **Database Management System (DBMS):** MySQL for storing user preferences.
- **Business Logic Layer:** Node.js for backend logic.
- **External APIs:** OpenWeatherMap API for weather data.

### 2. Define System Interfaces:
- RESTful API for fetching weather data.
- Database interface for managing user preferences.
- Authentication system for secure user login.
