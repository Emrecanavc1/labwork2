Purpose of Functional Requirements: They define what the system should do, such as features and functionalities that fulfill user needs (e.g., search for weather by city).

Difference Between Functional and Non-Functional Requirements:

Functional: "The app should display current temperature and humidity."
Non-functional: "The app should load within 2 seconds."
Importance of Prioritization: Helps focus on critical features first, manage resources efficiently, and meet deadlines.

Role of Use Cases: They help visualize user interaction with the system, ensuring developers understand the expected behavior and workflow.

Impact of Unclear Requirements: Leads to scope creep, miscommunication, rework, and project delays.

Main Components of a Use Case:

Title, Actor, Goal, Preconditions, Main Flow, Postconditions, Alternative Flows.
Helps developers understand the user's journey and system behavior.
Importance of Stakeholder Identification: Ensures all perspectives are considered, leading to a more comprehensive and user-friendly product.

User Stories vs Use Cases:

User Story: "As a user, I want to view weather updates."
Use Case: A detailed step-by-step interaction between the user and the system.
Importance of Documentation: Provides clarity, tracks progress, helps future maintenance, and ensures team collaboration.

System Requirements vs System Architecture:

Requirements: What the system should do.
Architecture: How the system is structured and functions.
Gathering Requirements from Remote Stakeholders: Use virtual meetings, collaborative tools like Trello or Jira, and regular feedback loops.

Challenges in Writing Non-Functional Requirements: Ambiguity, lack of metrics, and balancing performance with cost.

Role of UML Diagrams: Visualize system design, relationships, and data flow, aiding communication between developers and stakeholders.

Handling Difficult Requirements: Understand the underlying need, propose alternative solutions, and assess technical feasibility.

Evolution of a Requirements Specification Document: It evolves with user feedback, changing business needs, and new technology updates during the development lifecycle.
